The source behind NewsBlur is available on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/">http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/</a>. And recently, in response to a Hacker News thread about <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1465829">why RSS readers sucks</a>, I linked to NewsBlur and explained my rationale:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think I created a very nice feed reading experience with NewsBlur: <a href="http://www.newsblur.com">http://www.newsblur.com</a>.
<p>It shows the original site, allows you to read as you normally would, but keeps track of the stories you're scrolling past.
<p>It also allows you to filter stories based on what you like and dislike about them: words/phrases in the title, tags and categories, authors, and the publisher themselves. There is a slider that allows you to show/hide stories based on this filter. It's very fast, too.
<p>I am writing an iPhone app so you can use NewsBlur everywhere. It's just a hobby project, and people have so far been impressed. But I would love for NewsBlur to become a useful tool that people choose to use.
<p>I wrote it because I was also dissatisfied with readers, especially Google Reader. I also knew Python (Django!), JavaScript, and wanted to put them together to test my abilities.
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, I am writing the iPhone app that will allow NewsBlur to be useful to a significant portion of Internet users who read RSS. Everybody that I have talked to says they are waiting for a good mobile version before they sink in time and curation into NewsBlur. Let's hope I am not underestimating when I say 1-2 months.
