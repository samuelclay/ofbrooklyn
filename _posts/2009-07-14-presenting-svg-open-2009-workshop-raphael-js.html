<p>The
power of web browsers has reached the point when it is easy to use
native vector graphics without any 3rd party plugins and installs. In
this session, we will discover how to build rich graphics in your web
app using Raphal (http://raphaeljs.com/) JavaScript vector library,
the features Raphal provides, and walk through how to apply these
features into a fully built module.</p>
<p>This
course will cover a number of features ranging in complexity from basic
layout to event-driven interaction. The module will be a moderately
complex application consisting of parts SVG, Javascript, jQuery, and
HTML. While Javascript experience is expected, it is not necessary,
considering the syntax of Javascript in this capacity is not far
different than many other languages.</p>
<p>The
module, which will be used to demonstrate a number of techniques in
creating both interactive and layered elements in SVG, will be
sufficiently advanced as to cover many topics, but so in-depth that it
cannot be built entirely from scratch in the time allotted for the
course--including time used for demonstrating Raphal.</p>
<p>The 150 minute course will consist of 3 parts, with questions taken throughout: </p>
<ul>




<li>Introduction to Raphael (35 min)
<ul>




<li>5 minutes: Introduction and Overview of the People Connection widget </li>
<li>10 minutes: Looking at the Raphael JS Library's methods and documentation </li>
<li>10 minutes: Setting up data for the module to be used in drawing </li>
<li>10 minutes: Loading data into Raphael</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawing the widget (45 min) 
<ul>




<li>10 minutes: Images </li>
<li>15 minutes: Shapes </li>
<li>20 minutes: Lines, straight and curved (quadratic and bicubic) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interaction model (60 min) 
<ul>




<li>20 minutes: Handling user/triggered events </li>
<li>15 minutes: Animation </li>
<li>25 minutes: Interacting with the DOM and jQuery </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a time buffer built into each part, and if there is extra time, we will be prepared to discuss: </p>
<ul>




<li>Raphael versus other SVG/Javascript libraries </li>
<li>Other projects built on Raphael </li>
<li>Browser compatibility with Raphael </li>
</ul>
<p>For each section of the course, we plan to discuss: </p>
<ul>




<li>Implementation and coding conventions </li>
<li>Potential pitfalls with certain techniques (browser incompatibilities, misconceptions, and common mistakes) </li>
<li>Building the widget by coding in real-time (and not using blobs of code already written). </li>
</ul>
<p>The
flow of this walk-through course will be aligned with the building of
the module, where we will start with a empty file and progress over
each step used in creating the overall effect and feel of the finished
widget. Each piece of the widget puzzle will be complemented with a
demonstration of the incremental improvement. At the end of the course,
a complete module, with all of its pieces, will be fully functional and
fully explained. Participants will also have all of these Raphal
resources to use in their own SVG projects.</p>
