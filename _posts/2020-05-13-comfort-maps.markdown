<ul>
  <li>We can decide what our new normal looks like</li>
  <li>Resilience now a necessary goal for cities</li>
  <li>Climate goals</li>
  <li>Clean air goals</li>
  <li>Energy usage</li>
  <li>Transportation is 30% of emissions, largest share of all industries</li>
  <li>The 20th C. has asked how many cars can we move down the street</li>
  <li>The 21st C. should ask how many people can we move down the street</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.003.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Comfort Maps starts from the premise that we should have fewer cars in urban centers</li>
  <li>This is a gen3, it’s not even a spring chicken, a gen 4 is already on the way</li>
  <li>Incentivize new modes, and we reach climate goals we didn’t think possible</li>
  <li>The way to do that is to incentivize low emission vehicles</li>
  <li>And that’s through protected bike lanes</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.004.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>For advocates it’s obvious that we need to build bikes lanes</li>
  <li>When I spoke to people, it was clear there were many different priorities </li>
  <li>Advocates need help sharing their message</li>
  <li>Policy maker needs good data to make decisions</li>
  <li>And an easy way to hear from constituents</li>
  <li>because that’s what changes minds and gets things built</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.005.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Sharrows</li>
  <li>These are paint, in the middle of the lane</li>
  <li>This is a signal to cars</li>
  <li>According to some 2011 research done here in Cambridge, a sharrow is worth 15”</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.006.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Protection is bounded by the mindfulness of drivers beside you</li>
  <li>It’s just paint. </li>
  <li>Nothing between the slow lane and the fast lane.</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.007.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>A PBL is the gold standard</li>
  <li>This is a barrier, whether it’s bollards, or stanchions, or plants, and even parked cars</li>
  <li>All bike lanes have their worth, but they are not equal</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.008.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>2.5 times safer in a PBL than in painted bike lanes</li>
  <li>Barriers matter</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.009.jpg" width="100%">

Zooming out…

Strong & Fearless 5%: 
<ul>
  <li>Vehicular cyclists</li>
</ul>

Enthused & Confident 10%: 
<ul>
  <li>Basically everybody here who bikes</li>
</ul>

No Way No How 30%: 
<ul>
  <li>We should protect the ability to drive, because one day all of us will need it</li>
  <li>Includes recreational</li>
  <li>If they had PBLs, maybe they’d bike</li>
</ul>

Interested But Concerned:
<ul>
  <li>B/c a bike commute is only as strong as its most terrifying road segment</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.010.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>So I set out to find out how bike lanes are built</li>
  <li>I interviewed a dozen people involved in the process of building bike lanes </li>
  <li>Tensions between businesses, motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.011.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Hear what people say in a public forum to their elected reps</li>
  <li>Provide an outlet for the public to voice concerns on the record</li>
  <li>Here it’s a protected bike lane on Memorial Drive being proposed by the Department of Conservation & Recreation here in Cambridge</li>
  <li>Objections are about weather, emergency vehicles, and parking</li>
  <li>Truth is, this is still reactionary</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.012.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Even with the Cycling Safety Ordinance, which ensures the gradual building of separated bike lanes,</li>
  <li>We will see twenty more years of unnecessary deaths caused by lack of safe biking infrastructure.</li>
  <li>We can do better, but we should be more proactive than reactive</li>
</ul>


<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.013.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>And I think better data can help </li>
  <li>So what does that look like here in Cambridge</li>
  <li>Our perspective is CITY POLICY EVOLVES…</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.014.jpg" width="100%">

So let’s think about where the data can make a difference

Planning:
<ul>
  <li>Choosing streets</li>
</ul>

Design:
<ul>
  <li>Detailing what those streets look like</li>
</ul>

Construction:
<ul>
  <li>Build the thing</li>
</ul>

Operation:
<ul>
  <li>Maintenance </li>
</ul>

So how is it paid for?
<ul>
  <li>Cambridge does things differently</li>
  <li>We have participatory engagement</li>
  <li>There’s a lot more feedback mechanisms built in and that costs money</li>
  <li>But here that provides an opening for advocacy</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.015.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Because the Truth is, ONLY PROBLEMS AND POLITICAL WILL…</li>
  <li>So how do we change political will?</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.016.jpg" width="100%">

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.017.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>So I looked at precedents for how to build better road infrastructure</li>
  <li>I found precedents in two areas: One is reporting and ratings</li>
  <li>For tasks that are straight forward and out of compliance</li>
  <li>But not useful for advocacy</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.018.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>You can report bike lane damage but not get new bike lanes put in</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.019.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Here is a wishlist out of NYC Vision Zero</li>
  <li>Marking the priority corridors that are without bike lanes</li>
  <li>Important to note that the little green there is for both painted and protected bike lanes</li>
  <li>Problem with maps like this is that they are non-specific about WHY to build</li>
  <li>There’s no call to action here</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.020.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>You’re looking at a heat map of comments offered by about a thousand people</li>
  <li>Density map of commute popularity</li>
  <li>Nothing about wikimaps/seeclickfix surprises me about what needs to be improved</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.021.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Let’s look at the bike lanes we do have and figure out how useful they are</li>
  <li>The issue is no call too action, and it doesn’t make a case</li>
  <li>That’s really because it’s developed with a more objective method, LTS scores</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.022.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>These are objective measurements about the road that result in a rating</li>
  <li>Inputs are based on posted and observed speed limits, presence and width of bikeways, traffic volumes, and gaps in the network </li>
  <li>Plus, the Data is subject to availability and thoroughness of travel data </li>
  <li>But LTS aren’t 1:1 with actual comfort</li>
  <li>And they don’t account for a number of factors that turns a good street into a harrowing street</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.023.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.024.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Automatic comfort levels drawn from phone accelerometer data and user ratings</li>
  <li>It’s great, but it doesn’t take into account temporary obstructions (UPS truck in the bike lane)</li>
  <li>And no open data, can’t remix and contribute outside of a private app</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.025.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>So I noodled on all of those comfort maps and developed a system of design principles for what I would ultimately make</li>
  <li>I knew I wanted to make a hardware/software combination</li>
</ul>

Hardware
<ul>
  <li>Tactility and Safety are about being easy to rate without looking at a phone</li>
  <li>Instant feedback so the system was transparent</li>
  <li>Reliability so you can set it and forget it, it just works</li>
</ul>

Software
<ul>
  <li>Visualizable data to tell better stories</li>
  <li>Real-time feedback so you can tell that story without waiting on anybody</li>
  <li>Actionable data means having a call to action</li>
  <li>Community driven so data is bottom up, not top down</li>
</ul>


<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.026.jpg" width="100%">

Individual commuters:
<ul>
  <li>People like you and me who want to fix the gaps on their own commute</li>
</ul>

Advocacy groups:
<ul>
  <li>And their ability to mobilize groups of commuters to advocate for bike lanes</li>
</ul>

City Councilmembers:
<ul>
  <li>Politicians who want to understand better the road conditions and how to prioritize funding</li>
</ul>

People who never bike:
<ul>
  <li>For people who are maybe Cycle-curious</li>
  <li>Show experience on the street</li>
</ul>

Press:
<ul>
  <li>This is who you tell your story to, keeping in mind why they should care</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.027.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>So I ran an experiment</li>
  <li>6 people, 300 snapshots in a single afternoon</li>
  <li>This is subjective but quantified data</li>
  <li>1 is Inexcusable, 2 is Sucks, 3 is Not Great, 4 is Fine, 5 is Perfect</li>
  <li>And I thought, you know what this needs: A camera</li>
  <li>I want to know how you distinguish a 4 from a 5</li>
  <li>And I wanted to know what is normally a 5 suddenly turns to a 2 and what makes it go bad</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.028.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>So I designed built and codified the hardware</li>
  <li>First the board using Eagle</li>
  <li>Minted the boards</li>
  <li>Soldered them on that dining room table </li>
  <li>And then designed and assembled a device</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.029.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Five buttons and a camera</li>
  <li>Straps to your handlebars</li>
  <li>Got a low power IMU that puts it to sleep when not in use, and it tells you to charge it once a month</li>
  <li>Features atomic uploading, so it’s smart about uploading to both save power and work in different conditions</li>
  <li>Idea is that you can now capture those sticky situations</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.030.jpg" width="100%">

For Users, incentives are:
<ul>
  <li>Seamlessly participate in bike advocacy</li>
  <li>Make your commute route better by reporting infrastructures failures and dangerous bike lanes</li>
  <li>Rate their own commute: It’s a selfish need but that has a lot of incentive</li>
</ul>

Scaling up to system level, for everybody:
<ul>
  <li>Highlights where the infrastructure is inadequate and harmful</li>
  <li>Email your council members with snapshots to show the photo highlights and your lived experience</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.031.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>So when you use the camera, you use it with the comfort maps app</li>
  <li>This provides a map with your snapshots and a map of routes needing updating and capturing</li>
  <li>It’s now easy to snapshot the sticky situations</li>
  <li>All over your city and your commute </li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.032.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>Bring it full circle</li>
  <li>Once we have data we need to tell its story</li>
  <li>This notification closes the loop</li>
  <li>Advocacy groups can have teams and push out campaigns</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.033.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>That’s the individual side</li>
  <li>Now on the data visualization platform side, some of it people will come across as a tweet or a slack message, much like most news that gets shared today over social media</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.034.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.035.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>On the web using open web standards</li>
  <li>Heavy on Javascript and Mapbox GL</li>
  <li>And it’s mobile friendly</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.036.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>These features are available today at <a href="https://comfortmaps.com">comfortmaps.com</a></li>
  <li>A particular roadway may be comfortable for much of the day, but very uncomfortable during peak hours due to substantial increases in traffic.</li>
</ul>

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.040.jpg" width="100%">

<ul>
  <li>We have an opportunity to reset street design. </li>
  <li>CM is about helping municipalities make that choice.</li>
</ul>
