 * Presenting Comfort Maps, part of Harvard's Master in Design Engineering program</li>
  <li>Available today: [comfortmaps.com](https://comfortmaps.com)</li>
</ul>

 *  We can decide what our new normal looks like
 *  Resilience now a necessary goal for cities
 *  Climate goals, clean air goals, energy usage
 *  Transportation is 30% of emissions, largest share of all industries
 *  The 20th C. has asked how many cars can we move down the street
 *  The 21st C. should ask how many people can we move down the street

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.003.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Comfort Maps starts from the premise that we should have fewer cars in urban centers
 *  This is a gen3, it’s not even a spring chicken, a gen 4 is already on the way
 *  Incentivize new modes, and we reach climate goals we didn’t think possible
 *  The way to do that is to incentivize low emission vehicles
 *  And that’s through protected bike lanes

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.004.jpg" width="100%">

 *  For advocates it’s obvious that we need to build bikes lanes
 *  When I spoke to people, it was clear there were many different priorities 
 *  Advocates need help sharing their message
 *  Policy maker needs good data to make decisions
 *  And an easy way to hear from constituents
 *  because that’s what changes minds and gets things built

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.005.jpg" width="100%">

Sharrows

 *  These are paint, in the middle of the lane
 *  This is a signal to cars
 *  According to some 2011 research done here in Cambridge, a sharrow is worth 15”
 *  Cameras pointed at an intersection, two weeks before, two weeks after installing sharrow
 *  On average, cars gave 15" additional space to cyclists. That's not nothing.

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.006.jpg" width="100%">

Traditional bike lanes

 *  Protection is bounded by the mindfulness of drivers beside you
 *  It’s just paint. 
 *  Nothing between the slow lane and the fast lane.

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.007.jpg" width="100%">

Protected bike lanes

 *  A PBL is the gold standard
 *  This is a barrier, whether it’s bollards, or stanchions, or plants, and even parked cars
 *  All bike lanes have their worth, but they are not equal

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.008.jpg" width="100%">

 *  2.5 times safer in a PBL than in painted bike lanes
 *  Barriers matter

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.009.jpg" width="100%">

Zooming out…

Strong & Fearless 5%: 

 *  Vehicular cyclists

Enthused & Confident 10%: 

 *  Basically everybody here who bikes

No Way No How 30%: 

 *  We should protect the ability to drive, because one day all of us will need it
 *  Includes recreational
 *  If they had PBLs, maybe they’d bike

Interested But Concerned:

 *  B/c a bike commute is only as strong as its most terrifying road segment

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.010.jpg" width="100%">

 *  So I set out to find out how bike lanes are built
 *  I interviewed a dozen people involved in the process of building bike lanes 
 *  Tensions between businesses, motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.011.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Hear what people say in a public forum to their elected reps
 *  Provide an outlet for the public to voice concerns on the record
 *  Here it’s a protected bike lane on Memorial Drive being proposed by the Department of Conservation & Recreation here in Cambridge
 *  Objections are about weather, emergency vehicles, and parking
 *  Truth is, this is still reactionary

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.012.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Even with the Cycling Safety Ordinance, which ensures the gradual building of separated bike lanes,
 *  We will see twenty more years of unnecessary deaths caused by lack of safe biking infrastructure.
 *  We can do better, but we should be more proactive than reactive


<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.013.jpg" width="100%">

 *  And I think better data can help 
 *  So what does that look like here in Cambridge
 *  Our perspective is CITY POLICY EVOLVES…

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.014.jpg" width="100%">

So let’s think about where the data can make a difference

Planning:

 *  Choosing streets

Design:

 *  Detailing what those streets look like

Construction:

 *  Build the thing

Operation:

 *  Maintenance 

So how is it paid for?

 *  Cambridge does things differently
 *  We have participatory engagement
 *  There’s a lot more feedback mechanisms built in and that costs money
 *  But here that provides an opening for advocacy

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.015.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Because the Truth is, ONLY PROBLEMS AND POLITICAL WILL…
 *  So how do we change political will?

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.016.jpg" width="100%">

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.017.jpg" width="100%">

 *  So I looked at precedents for how to build better road infrastructure
 *  I found precedents in two areas: One is reporting and ratings
 *  For tasks that are straight forward and out of compliance
 *  But not useful for advocacy

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.018.jpg" width="100%">

 *  You can report bike lane damage but not get new bike lanes put in

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.019.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Here is a wishlist out of NYC Vision Zero
 *  Marking the priority corridors that are without bike lanes
 *  Important to note that the little green there is for both painted and protected bike lanes
 *  Problem with maps like this is that they are non-specific about WHY to build
 *  There’s no call to action here

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.020.jpg" width="100%">

 *  You’re looking at a heat map of comments offered by about a thousand people
 *  Density map of commute popularity
 *  Nothing about wikimaps/seeclickfix surprises me about what needs to be improved

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.021.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Let’s look at the bike lanes we do have and figure out how useful they are
 *  The issue is no call too action, and it doesn’t make a case
 *  That’s really because it’s developed with a more objective method, LTS scores

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.022.jpg" width="100%">

 *  These are objective measurements about the road that result in a rating
 *  Inputs are based on posted and observed speed limits, presence and width of bikeways, traffic volumes, and gaps in the network 
 *  Plus, the Data is subject to availability and thoroughness of travel data 
 *  But LTS aren’t 1:1 with actual comfort
 *  And they don’t account for a number of factors that turns a good street into a harrowing street

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.023.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.024.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Automatic comfort levels drawn from phone accelerometer data and user ratings
 *  It’s great, but it doesn’t take into account temporary obstructions (UPS truck in the bike lane)
 *  And no open data, can’t remix and contribute outside of a private app

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.025.jpg" width="100%">

 *  So I noodled on all of those comfort maps and developed a system of design principles for what I would ultimately make
 *  I knew I wanted to make a hardware/software combination

Hardware

 *  Tactility and Safety are about being easy to rate without looking at a phone
 *  Instant feedback so the system was transparent
 *  Reliability so you can set it and forget it, it just works

Software

 *  Visualizable data to tell better stories
 *  Real-time feedback so you can tell that story without waiting on anybody
 *  Actionable data means having a call to action
 *  Community driven so data is bottom up, not top down


<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.026.jpg" width="100%">

Individual commuters:

 *  People like you and me who want to fix the gaps on their own commute

Advocacy groups:

 *  And their ability to mobilize groups of commuters to advocate for bike lanes

City Councilmembers:

 *  Politicians who want to understand better the road conditions and how to prioritize funding

People who never bike:

 *  For people who are maybe Cycle-curious
 *  Show experience on the street

Press:

 *  This is who you tell your story to, keeping in mind why they should care

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.027.jpg" width="100%">

 *  So I ran an experiment
 *  6 people, 300 snapshots in a single afternoon
 *  This is subjective but quantified data
 *  1 is Inexcusable, 2 is Sucks, 3 is Not Great, 4 is Fine, 5 is Perfect
 *  And I thought, you know what this needs: A camera
 *  I want to know how you distinguish a 4 from a 5
 *  And I wanted to know what is normally a 5 suddenly turns to a 2 and what makes it go bad

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.028.jpg" width="100%">

 *  So I designed built and codified the hardware
 *  First the board using Eagle
 *  Minted the boards
 *  Soldered them on that dining room table 
 *  And then designed and assembled a device

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.029.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Five buttons and a camera
 *  Straps to your handlebars
 *  Got a low power IMU that puts it to sleep when not in use, and it tells you to charge it once a month
 *  Features atomic uploading, so it’s smart about uploading to both save power and work in different conditions
 *  Idea is that you can now capture those sticky situations

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.030.jpg" width="100%">

For Users, incentives are:

 *  Seamlessly participate in bike advocacy
 *  Make your commute route better by reporting infrastructures failures and dangerous bike lanes
 *  Rate their own commute: It’s a selfish need but that has a lot of incentive

Scaling up to system level, for everybody:

 *  Highlights where the infrastructure is inadequate and harmful
 *  Email your council members with snapshots to show the photo highlights and your lived experience

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.031.jpg" width="100%">

 *  So when you use the camera, you use it with the comfort maps app
 *  This provides a map with your snapshots and a map of routes needing updating and capturing
 *  It’s now easy to snapshot the sticky situations
 *  All over your city and your commute 

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.032.jpg" width="100%">

 *  Bring it full circle
 *  Once we have data we need to tell its story
 *  This notification closes the loop
 *  Advocacy groups can have teams and push out campaigns

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.033.jpg" width="100%">

 *  That’s the individual side
 *  Now on the data visualization platform side, some of it people will come across as a tweet or a slack message, much like most news that gets shared today over social media

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.034.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.035.jpg" width="100%">

 *  On the web using open web standards
 *  Heavy on Javascript and Mapbox GL
 *  And it’s mobile friendly

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.036.jpg" width="100%">

 *  These features are available today at <a href="https://comfortmaps.com">comfortmaps.com</a>
 *  A particular roadway may be comfortable for much of the day, but very uncomfortable during peak hours due to substantial increases in traffic.

<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.037.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.038.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.039.jpg" width="100%">



<img src="/media/photos/comfortmaps/Comfort Maps IDEP Final.040.jpg" width="100%">

 *  We have an opportunity to reset street design. 
 *  CM is about helping municipalities make that choice.
